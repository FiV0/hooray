# Hooray ðŸŽ‰

This is *very beta*.

### Examples

### Inspiration
Some projects I have looked at and drawn some inspiration from

- [asami](https://github.com/quoll/asami) - Graph database written Clojure(script)
- [xtdb](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb) - General-purpose bitemporal database for SQL, Datalog & graph queries.

### Glossary

* triple - generally refers to an [e a v] triple, sometimes also in a different order
* pattern - refers to a non yet instantiated triple, could contain variables but does not have to
* clause - more generally a where clause. Could be a triple but maybe also a different kind of clause.

## License

I copied two files from [asami](https://github.com/quoll/asami) in the beginning which are licenced
under the EPL 1.0. The files are marked explicitly in the header.

Everything else is under the MIT Licence. In some cases copyrighted to a different party as I copied some code.
See the `LICENCE` file and the headers of files.

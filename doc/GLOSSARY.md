# Glossary

Some terminology we try to use consistently across the repo.

* triple - generally refers to an [e a v] triple as values, sometimes also in a different order
* pattern - refers to a non yet instantiated triple, could contain variables but does not have to
* tuple - pattern + order [:e :a :v]
* clause - more generally a where clause. Could be a triple but maybe also a different kind of clause.
